> [!CAUTION]
> This project is just PoC sample. Not production ready!


- [Play Integrity Documentation](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity/overview)
- Enable API in Cloud Console - [Google Play Integrity API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/playintegrity.googleapis.com)
- Enable API in Google Play console - [Select app](https://play.google.com/console/u/0/developers/) > Test and release > App integrity
- Create a service account in Cloud console and his service key (JSON) store into `.private/` folder.
- Edit [Config.kt](./src/main/kotlin/Config.kt) to provide proper service account key path.
- Run this project webserver
- Implement Android FE part ðŸ¤–

## Backend part

- Uses [backend Google Play Integrity API](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-java-client-services/tree/main/clients/google-api-services-playintegrity/v1) dependency

---

## Android part

- Obtain Token from Integrity API SDK (as described in [Play Integrity Documentation](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity/standard)) 
- call `POST http://[THIS-SERVER:8080]/play/integrity/all` and add `IntegrityQuery` as body. Into this body just put token taken from SDK.


```kotlin
@Serializable
data class IntegrityQuery(
    @SerialName("token")
    val token: String,
)
```

Response will contains json with content of [TokenPayloadExternal](https://googleapis.dev/java/google-api-services-playintegrity/latest/index.html?com/google/api/services/playintegrity/v1/model/TokenPayloadExternal.html)
